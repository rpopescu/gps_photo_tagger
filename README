geo-tags photos using nmea logs
* own nmea log file parsing
* uses the excellent exiftool (http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool) to tag (regular images and camera RAW files!)
* matches based on timestamps
* testing with photos from Canon Ixus and 400D and nmea logs from an AMOD AGL3080
* work in progress
